There are some ways to achieve anonimity in the Internet, every method guarantee some level of anonimity from someone.

For anonimity to work, there is always something that has to be trusted.

1. Incognito mode in the browsers: in this case you don’t get anonimity from your Internet Service Provider or the Government. You’re getting anonimity from other people that want to use the same computer.
The trusted entity that guarantees anonimity is the browser.
2. VPN: in this case you don’t connect directly to the final server, but you connect first to a proxy, and than this connects to the server. 
You get anonimity from ISP but not on the Government, since they still can get a log of connections from the VPN provider. 
The trusting entity is the VPN provider.
3. TOR provides anonimity from both the ISP and the Government.
