## The manifold hypothesis (just an intuitionâ€¦)

Deep learning makes a big assumption, which is that the input data lives on an underlying non-Euclidean structured called a manifold.

In this manifold there are subspaces where the same type of objects exists. For example in a certain subspace there may be only photos of mountains.
