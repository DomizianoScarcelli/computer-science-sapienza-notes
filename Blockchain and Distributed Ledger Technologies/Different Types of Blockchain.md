Blockchains can be:
- Private: only a set of selected nodes can transact and view
- Public: every node can transact and view.
And the consensus can be:
- Permissionless: all nodes can partecipate in consensus;
- Permissioned: only selected node can partecipate in consensus.
### Which blockchain do I need?
We can use a flowchart to know if we do need a blockchain in the first place, and, if so, which one.
