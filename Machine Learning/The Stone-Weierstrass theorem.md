The *Stone-Weierstrass* theorem tell us that:

> If $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$, then for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a polynomial $p$ such that $|f(x) - p(x)| < \epsilon \quad \forall x$.

In other terms, every continuous function can be approximated by some polynomial with a certain level of accuracy. This is why in ML polynomial are used so much.
