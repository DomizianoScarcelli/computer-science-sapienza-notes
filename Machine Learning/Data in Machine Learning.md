Machine learning means learning from the data, so that’s the most important part. The first thing that has to be done is to look at the data, since it can be structured or not.

If we don’t look at the data, it may happen that we miss the underlying structure and so we don’t understand the results, or we can make some mistakes.

In this example we can see that all the quadrants but $I$ has some structure, but the statistics are exactly the same for every dataset. This shouldn’t be the case since they have very different structures, so statistics alone cannot be trusted.

Sometimes data cannot be visualized because of the highly dimentional space in which it’s defined, or because there isn’t a physical access to it.

Learning means describing the process (or the model) that yields a given output from a given input.
