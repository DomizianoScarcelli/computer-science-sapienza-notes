- **2D model:** we can represent a face with a simple image made of RGB pixels;
- **2.5D model:** is an half way representation between 2D and 3D. We can use a Range Image, that is a 2D grid where the values of each pixel represent the distance between the point and the light source. Itâ€™s useful to have information about the 3D space without actually building a 3D model.
- **3D model**: we can use a shaded model, that models a 3D object by building it with many polygons. Smaller the polygons, the better the 3D reconstruction.
