We define $TI$ as the True Impostor attemptsz, $TG$ as the True Genuine attempts. This values depends on the type of recognition (identification or verification).

- The **Genuine Acceptance Rate** (GAR) is the number of genuine acceptances over the number of all the genuine claims.

$$
GAR = \frac{GA}{TG}
$$

- On the other hand, the **Genuine Rejection Rate** (GRR) ****is the number of genuine rejections, over the number of all impostor claims.

$$
GRR = \frac{GR}{TI}
$$

Note that $FRR + GAR = 1$ and $FAR + GRR = 1$.
