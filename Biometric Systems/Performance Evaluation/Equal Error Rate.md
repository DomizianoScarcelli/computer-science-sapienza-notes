FAR and FRR have opposite trends with respect to the threshold.

The equal error rate (ERR) is the error rate when the two distributions (FAR and FRR) have the same value.

## ZeroFRR and ZeroFAR

The ZeroFAR point is the value of the $FRR$ when we have $FAR = 0$;

On the other hand, ZeroFRR point is the value of $FAR$ when we have $FRR = 0$.
