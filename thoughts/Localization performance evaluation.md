It’s possible to evaluate the performances of a face localizer by seeing the percentage of false positives and of “Not localized faces”.

It’s also possible to calculate the $C$-error, that is based non only on the possible misclassification of the region of the image, but also on the correct localization. The localization error is defined as the euclidean distance between the real center of the face and the one estimated by the system.
