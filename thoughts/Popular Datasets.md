There are some popular public databases like FERET that contain images of the same person in different poses, illuminations and times. The photos in the database are normalized according to the position of the eyes, in order to have images all of the same size.

Another popular dataset is AR-Faces, that contains photos of faces in some variations of expressions, going from neutral to smile, anger and scream.
