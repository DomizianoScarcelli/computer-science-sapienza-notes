In order to the performances of two or more systems, measures like [[False Acceptance Rate and False Rejection Rate | FAR, FRR]], [[Cumulative Match Score and Cumulative Match Characteristic Curve (CMS and CMC)|CMS]] are not sufficient since they are not so much correlated to the real operation context.

We should also consider other metrics, such as:
- Number of used dataset, in order to evaluate the generalizability of the system;
- Image size: larger and higher quality image provide more information but also more noise;
- Probe and Gallery size: the size must be reasonably big in order to guarantee generalizability;
- Number and level of tolerated variations: this also guarantees robustness and generalizability, since in most of the cases for public systems, we cannot take for granted that a person will always appear the same.

## FERET program

The FERET (Facial Evaluation Recognition Technology) was a program invented in 1993 that aimed to create a large and automatic face-recognition system. Before that date, a lot of facial recognition systems claimed a very high accuracy on a small sized database, but few of these systems used a common database.

The first evaluation on the FERET database took place in the August of 1994, the second in March 1995, the third on September 1996.
