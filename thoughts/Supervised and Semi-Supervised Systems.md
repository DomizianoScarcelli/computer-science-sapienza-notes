A possible solution to increase the reliability of the system is to have many templates in the gallery, but also to update templates in the gallery with new probes. This may happen in two different scenarios:

- **Supervised** system: there is a person that act as a supervisor that, once a person is recognized, determines if that recognition was correct and, if so, includes that probe template into the gallery.
- **Semi-Supervised** system: there is no human supervisor, but the recognition is determined as correct or not in an automatic way.

This is also useful when there are poor quality templates in the gallery set. Itâ€™s possible to update the template in the gallery with an higher quality one, once the probe template has been verified to be authentic.
